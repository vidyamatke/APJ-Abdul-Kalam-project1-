                    is a pioneer in fibre glass technology and led a young team to
                    initiate this effort in ISRO from design, development leading to
                    production of composites rocket motor cases. Dr. Kalam made
                    significant contribution as Project Director to develop India’s
                    first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3) which
